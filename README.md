# Learn Kannada with Simple Game

This is a small web app I created to help myself learn Kannada vocabulary, meanings, and simple sentence structures ‚Äî especially from a Bengali background. It's a basic game-based approach to reinforce learning through repetition and interaction.

## üìå Why I Made This
As a Bengali speaker trying to learn Kannada, I found that most apps either:
- Don't support learning through my native language (Bengali),
- Are not free, or
- Are too complex for quick, everyday learning.

So, I decided to build a simple tool tailored for my needs ‚Äî something easy, interactive, and focused.

## üí° Features
- Basic vocabulary with Kannada words and meanings
- Simple sentence practice
- A fun quiz-style game to reinforce learning
- Completely web-based and lightweight

## üôå Who Can Use This?
Even though I made it for my own use case, anyone interested in learning Kannada ‚Äî especially Bengali speakers ‚Äî might find it helpful. Feel free to use it!

## üöÄ Try it Out
You can view and use the app here:

## üîß Improvements Welcome!
This is an early version, and I'm always open to feedback or corrections ‚Äî especially from native speakers or fellow learners.
